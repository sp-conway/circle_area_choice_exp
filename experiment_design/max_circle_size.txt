how we arrive at max circle size
circle_square_max_length = round ((s_middle_x-2*rect_dist_px)/3);

s_middle_x = 1920 / 2 = 960
rect_dist=.05
rect_dist_px =  round(s_middle_x*rect_dist) = 48

max length = round ((960 - 2*48 )/3) = 288
max_circle_area = round(area_from_rad(.5*circle_square_max_length));
max circle area = round (pi * (288/2)^2 )
